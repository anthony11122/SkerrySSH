/**
 * Assistant panel controller: a conversation about one open session, under the host's [AiPolicy].
 *
 * Safety invariants, the same ones the one-shot bar carried:
 * - The controller never executes anything. It produces text; the panel extracts commands
 *   ([AssistantAnswer]) and sends one to the shell only on an explicit click.
 * - Policy plus settings pick the endpoint through [AiRouter]: [AiPolicy.Strict] stays on the local
 *   model, so terminal output attached as context never reaches the cloud. [AiPolicy.Off] never
 *   reaches a request ([aiEnabled] hides the panel).
 * - Prompt and attached output are redacted together ([SecretRedactor]) when the policy asks for it,
 *   *before* they are written to [turns] — the feed shows exactly what was sent.
 *
 * Context travels with the question it belongs to and is not replayed in later requests: the reply
 * it produced stays in the history, and re-sending screens of output every turn would leak more and
 * cost more.
 *
 * Independent of Vault: settings come from the [settings] lambda, [localInstalled] reports whether
 * the local model is downloaded on this device.
